# Health Monitoring Device

**Source:** General  
**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement
A company developing a health monitoring wearable device conducts a study to determine the device’s effectiveness in improving users’ physical activity levels. They distribute the device to 500 volunteers who self-reported low activity levels and ask them to use it for 3 months. The study measures the increase in the average number of steps per day. Discuss the potential biases that could affect the study’s conclusions and how you might redesign the study to mitigate these biases.

## Approach
Key Takeaways:
1) Three critical biases threaten validity: self-selection bias (volunteers already motivated), reporting bias (self-reported data inaccuracies), and survivorship bias (focusing only on study completers)
2) Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) represent the gold standard for mitigating self-selection bias by introducing a control group
3) Objective measurement tools eliminate reporting bias by replacing self-reports with device-captured data 
4) Survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier, Cox Proportional Hazards) handle censored data from participant dropouts
5) Diverse participant pools improve generalizability across demographics
