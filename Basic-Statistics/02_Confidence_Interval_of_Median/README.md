# Confidence Interval of Median

**Source:** Google  
**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement
How would you get the Confidence Interval of Median?

## Approach
Bootstrapping gives a flexible, assumption‑light way to estimate the confidence interval of the median. Instead of relying on analytic formulas, you let the data speak by repeatedly resampling it.​

## Solution
See `solution.ipynb` for the Python implementation, simulation, or proof.
