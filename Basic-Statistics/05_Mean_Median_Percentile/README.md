# Mean, Median, Percentile

**Source:** General  
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement
When would you use the mean, median, and percentile?

## Approach
Normal distribution?
- Use mean or median (they'll be nearly identical)
Skewed distribution or outliers present?
- Use median for central tendency
- Report mean alongside for completeness, but don't rely on it alone
Need tail insights (low/high extremes)?
- Use percentiles (p10, p90, p95, p99, etc.)

## Solution
See `solution.ipynb` for the Python implementation, simulation, or proof.
