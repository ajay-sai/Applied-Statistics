# Applied Statistics Learning Journey

A comprehensive repository documenting my Applied Statistics learning journey through curated questions from top tech companies and general statistical concepts. This repository tracks daily progress with solutions, explanations, and visualizations.

## 📚 Course Structure

This repository is organized into five main topic areas:

### 1. Basic Statistics (5 questions)
- Confidence intervals
- Variance estimation
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, percentile)

### 2. Statistical Bias (3 questions)
- Survey bias
- Measurement bias
- Simpson's Paradox

### 3. Probability (15 questions)
- Uniform and other distributions
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Conditional probability
- Bayesian inference

### 4. Hypothesis Testing (15 questions)
- T-tests and Z-tests
- P-values and confidence intervals
- Central Limit Theorem
- Type I and Type II errors
- Multiple testing

### 5. Regression Analysis (10 questions)
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Model assumptions and diagnostics
- R-squared and model evaluation

## 📁 Repository Organization

Each topic folder contains numbered subfolders for individual questions:

```

### Each Question Folder Contains:

- **README.md**: Problem statement, approach, resources, and links to explanations
  - Source and difficulty level
  - Problem description
  - Approach and key concepts
  - Links to LinkedIn posts and Substack articles
  - Additional resources and references

- **solution.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with Python implementation
  - Code, simulations, or mathematical proofs
  - Visualizations and analysis
  - Step-by-step explanations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Notebooks

1. Start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Navigate to the desired question folder
3. Open `solution.ipynb`
4. Run the cells to see the analysis and visualizations

## 📝 Daily Workflow

### Adding a New Question Solution

1. **Navigate to the question folder** (already created as placeholders)

2. **Update README.md**:
   - Fill in the problem statement
   - Add your approach and understanding
   - Link your LinkedIn post explaining the concept
   - Link your Substack article with detailed explanation
   - Add any helpful resources or references

3. **Complete solution.ipynb**:
   - Implement your solution using Python
   - Add visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn
   - Include simulations or mathematical proofs where applicable
   - Document your code with markdown cells

4. **Commit your changes**:
```bash
git add <topic>/<question-folder>/
git commit -m "Add solution for <Question Title>"
git push
```
